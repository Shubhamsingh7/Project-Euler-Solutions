# Project-Euler-Solutions
Solutions of Project Euler Coding Problems


Each Folder is Having Name "Euler and a number",number denotes question number of Project Euler
eg euler-3 denotes solution of  3rd question in  Project Euler



******************************************************************************************************************************************

# These Solutions may not be optimised,as some of them take upto a minute to return answer
# as most of them are solved using iterative approach
# some of them can give better optimised result using dynamic programming,divide and Conquer and other programing paradigm
